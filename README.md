## 🚀 About me

I’m a B.Tech IT graduate from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra (Class of 2025) with hands-on experience in data analytics, SQL-based data modeling, and cloud analytics workflows.

I work at the intersection of SQL, cloud data platforms, and BI tools to transform raw, messy data into analytics-ready datasets and actionable insights. I’ve built data warehouses, ETL pipelines, and dashboards, with applied exposure to machine learning for analytical problem-solving and anomaly detection.

I’m currently focused on entry-level Data Analyst / Cloud Analytics roles where data quality, scalability, and business impact matter.
